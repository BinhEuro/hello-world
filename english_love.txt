 1. I would cross a thousand oceans just to hold you tight.
 I would climb a thousand mountains just to be with you every single night. 
 Darling I miss you so much.

 2. To the world, you may be one person. But to me, you are the world.

 3. If there’s someone asking me about you. I won’t be able to tell them.
 “Cos, I’ve never been taught how to describe an angel…”

 4.When life gives you a hundred reasons to cry,
 show life that you have a thousand reasons to smile.
 
 5. Life is not fair - get used to it.

 6. Life is short, smile while you still have teeth.

 7. Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety - nine percent perspiration.

 8. Where there is a will, there is a way.

 9. On the way to success, there is no trace of lazy men.

 10. If you are trying to achieve, there will be roadblocks.
 I have had them; everybody has had them. But obstacles don't
 have to stop you. If you run into the wall, don't turn around
and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.

 11. I can accept failure, everyone fails at something.
 But I can't accept not trying.

 12. A winner never stops trying.
